Elite play relies on efficient footwork, balance control, and shot creation via angles, elevation, and touch. Universal Foundations • Athletic stance: feet slightly wider than shoulders, knees soft, hips back, chest tall, weight on mid‑foot/forefoot. • Balance & base: landings and takeoffs in line; avoid drifting sideways unless intentionally creating space. • Alignment: shooting side (eye‑elbow‑knee‑toe) aligned to target; slight toe‑in is acceptable if repeatable. • Sequencing: ground → hips → torso → arm → wrist; smooth energy transfer without jerks. • Eyes & focus: pick an aiming cue (front rim, back rim, or backboard spot) and commit to it through release. Footwork & Movement • Jump stop &",

Footwork & Movement • Jump stop & stride stop: arrive on balance to shoot, pass, or pivot either foot. • Pivots: inside/outside pivots to create passing lanes and shot space; keep pivot foot quiet. • Decel mechanics: sit hips, lower center of mass, short braking steps to stop under control from speed. • First step: explosive hip drive; rip the ball through the frame and attack the lead foot of the defender. • Change of direction: cross‑step, hip turn, and drop steps; maintain low shin angle for acceleration. • Vertical jumping: load through ankles‑knees‑hips; arms swing up; land softly with knee/hip alignment.

Common fixes: front‑rim → add arc or power; back‑rim hard → reduce speed or arc; left/right → check foot/hip alignment and follow‑through. Finishing at the Rim (Layups, Reverse, Floaters) • Standard layup: outside foot last step; eyes on inside square; extend high and finish off glass with soft touch. • Reverse layup: use rim as protection; aim above opposite corner of the square; keep body between ball and defender. • Euro step: long lateral step then opposite step to avoid charge; keep ball protected across the body. • Pr",
